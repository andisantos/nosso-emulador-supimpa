# N.E.S.
This is a prototype of a NES emulator which tries to be simple and small.  

It implements the CPU and PPU fully, and is able to run Super Mario Bros, Excitebike, and others.  

No mappers are implemented, which means there aren't many games one can test this against.  


# How to compile and run
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/lcagustini/nosso-emulador-supimpa.git
    make
    ./bin/main.x game.nes
    ```
